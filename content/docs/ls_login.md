# Life Science (LS) Login

LS Login is a federated identity and access management service that provides a single, trusted
login for accessing various services within the life sciences. It allows you to use your existing
institutional or commercial accounts (like Google or ORCID) to log in, and links them to your
unique LS ID. This means you don't need separate credentials for each service.

## Obtain LS ID (Register)

Registering for an LS ID is simple:

    link](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login/users/how-to-get-and-use-life-science-id.html#how-to-get-ls-id).
2.  **Choose Account:** Select your home organization or use a supported commercial/community 
    service (e.g., Google, ORCID) to log in with your personal credentials. Alternatively, create a
    LS account with a dedicated password.
3.  **Complete Form & Verify:** Fill in the registration form, accept the usage policy, and submit. You'll receive a verification email; click the link to confirm your email address.

You have successfully registered your LS ID and can now use it to access connected services.
